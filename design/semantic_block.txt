SEMANTIC BLOCK
In the land of Smorgur, there are two kinds of dragon: Goruns and Fodur. Some dragons are carnivores and some dragons are herbivores.
Your task is to gure out if a carnivore or an herbivore is MOST LIKELY a Gorun or Fodur.
Because category membership is probabilistic, you answer cannot always be 100% correct. By picking the most likely category to which a carnivore or herbivore belongs,
you can be correct most (but not all) of the time. The following carnivores and herbivores are drawn at random from Gorun and Fodur dragons. Classify each
carnivore and each herbivore as either a Gorun or a Fodur.
When you have consistently picked the most likely dragon for the last 200 trials, your learning will be complete.
LEFT arrow = GORUN; RIGHT arrow = FODUR.
