VISUAL BLOCK
In the land of Smorgur, there are two kinds of dragon: Goruns and Fodurs. Goruns look more like a circle and Fodurs look more like a figure 8.
Gorun and Fodur eggs are usually of different color. However, some Gorun eggs look like Fodur eggs, and some Fodur eggs look like Gorun eggs.
Your task is to learn THE MOST LIKELY dragon category to which an egg belongs, even if sometimes an identical-looking egg can be either a Gorun or Fodur egg.
Because category membership is probabilistic, your answer cannot always be 100% correct. By picking the most likely category to which the egg belongs, you can
be correct most (but not all) of the time. The following eggs are drawn at random from Gorun and Fodur eggs. Classify each egg as either a Gorun or a Fodur egg.
When you have consistently picked the most likely dragon for the last 200 trials, your learning will be complete.
LEFT arrow = GORUN egg; RIGHT arrow = FODUR egg.
